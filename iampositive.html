            <p class="date">January 10th 2022</p>
            <h2 id="covid">Covid!</h2>
<p>I had developed fever on 3rd Jan. My mother was ill since the night of 31st December. I did not know then, that it would turn out to be covid. On 3rd evening I got throat pain and by night I was deep below blankets because of shivering cold. Next day BOOM Covid.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>Well overall its been a very tough journey. The body pain itself was killing. But then I would like to point out some essential take away stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intense Body pain</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Generation of Cough</li>
<li>Burning body fever (I had fever of 105 F for 3 consecutive days ü§íüå°Ô∏è)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Get yourself tested as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-did-i-come-to-know">How did I come to know</h2>
<p>The very next day on 4th I got myself tested. First RAT(Rapid Antigen test) was taken. It showed result as undecidable. Next RTPCR test was taken, which was positive. I started my medication that very day itself.</p>
<h2 id="remedy">Remedy</h2>
<p>First off don&#39;t panick.</p>
<p>Next, as per the prescribed medication, just start it off. Covid is not a big deal if you have no comorbidities. The body will take time to fight back the nasty virus. SO best strategy is to eat as much possible, get medicine and sleep through the day. </p>
<p>Also, do a lot of breathing exercises. Eat dry-fruits. Take proper sleep and rest. Keep yourself hydrated.</p>
<p><strong>End Note:</strong> This is just like any other flu, its just that people have hyped it up a lot. Yes, it weakens the body a lot, but other than that you can win back this war.</p>
<p>Keep yourself safe, and protect your loved once.</p>
