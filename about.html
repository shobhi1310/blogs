<h2 id="about-the-author">About the author</h2>
<p>Hello eveyone!!</p>
<p>I am Shubhankar Bhadra.</p>
<p>I am a male born on 13th October 1999. I am a native Indian and was born in the industrial city of Bokaro in Jharkhand.
I am bengali by ethnicity and my parents hail from Tripura.</p>
<p>I have studies my schooling life from Delhi Public School Bokaro. Currently I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from Indian Insitute of technology, Tirupati.
I love exploring new stuff and I do a lot of over thinking which will be evident from my posts.</p>
<h2 id="content-supported">Content supported</h2>
<p>I like thinking a lot irrespective of the topic of interest and I also like expressing my views on such topics. According to me, the best way of understanding onself,
is through continuous discussion and retrospection. In the hindsite this also will help me in improving my writing skills and also act as a journal entry
for my future self to look back on my thoughts and compare with my future-self.</p>
<p>My interest areas are pretty wide-ranged. Though being truthful to my career I might be posting more on development work and experiences. But, don&#39;t get amazed
on finding a review on some film or a fuzzy monologue on existencce of life at times, becuase I keep bumping on different thoughts time-to-time.</p>
<p>Hope, you like my viewpoints.</p>
