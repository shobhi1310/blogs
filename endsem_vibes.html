            <h2 id="a-free-life">A Free Life</h2>
<p>Till now recently, I always thought that I would have a free life when I am in control of my life. I would be working in some job, I would be earning for myself, I would be enjoying the work environment and also witness some major decision making power as well. But now that my end sem is going right now, I looked back upon my entire thought process and I feel I was much free till now, and that very freedom is going to be taken away soon.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-freedom">What is freedom?</h2>
<p>For me it means, expressing and executing one&#39;s set of thoughts without any objection by any person without harming someone&#39;s interest. </p>
<p>And this definition of freedom has always been the same for me, but the meaning of expression and execution has changed as time went by.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before teen-age, watching TV, playing games were the execution</li>
<li>At teen age, talking with friends, gossipping, not liking study much was the execution</li>
<li>College was about expressing oneself among college peer in all aspects possible to become popular</li>
</ul>
<p>I can elaborate each line extinsively, but these are for for later times, like when I want to get some sense of relief and want to relieve my past times. For now, I just gave some direct thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="way-ahead">Way ahead...</h2>
<p>As I thought, I would gain freedom, I would like to also ad that it is not gaining freedom, but more of exploring more about freedom. At this point, when I step to the new phase of life, to the outside world, I can&#39;t really express myself to a certain extent at workplace or social life as I am bounded by rules of society and have to be answerable. Till now, my parents were bounded and my execution was to experience freedom under that bubble set by my parents.</p>
<p>Now, the bubble is broken and I see a rigid world where boundaries are fixed and people have drowned themsleves in these rules, I see no hope of light which would wash of this sleepiness from us.</p>
<pre><code>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action 
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>I wish I were that small kid who had a fire in his eyes to revolt against the slightest dismay. Now that my shackles have been unlocked, I have no purpose but just keep waiting for my demise.</p>
