            <p>😥😓😖</p>
<p>My previous commitment of posting something every week just broke in the first week itself.</p>
<p>Currently I was busy in intersnhip and entertainement, latter being the crucial part 😅.</p>
<p>I have been learning some new technical aspects lately such as docker, aws, full stack development for frontend, etc.</p>
<p>I have also watched the 5th series of Lucifer along with some other movies not much to be happy about.</p>
<p>What I have understood so far is that, life becomes completely monotonous in the long run after a following a strict schedule. So, some
flexibility must be present in our daily routine for some time to bring back the old spirit of work. It should not be too much of a leisure
that the body and soul gets accustomed to.</p>
<p>Basically, it should be like salt in food, neither too salty, nor too flat, and we are the chef.</p>
<p>I will start writing about development works that I learnt so far soon. And let&#39;s see if my regular habit of posting per week sustains or not 🤞🏻.</p>
