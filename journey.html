            <p class="date">October 31st 2023</p>
            <h1 id="🫡-brief">🫡 Brief</h1>
<p>I was busy doing a lot of stuff. I joined a start-up as software engineer. Learnt a lot about industry and skills. Spent a good time with my love. Jumped back to some higher studies preparation. In the meantime I started living with my mom. Changed my residence from a PG to a 2BHK sharing to a 2BHK fully owned, all on rent though.</p>
<p>Went through increment cycle. Got demotivated. Started looking into other areas. Finally, remembered I had a blog site to maintain also.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-really-happened">So What really happened.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well, I turned 24 a few days back.</li>
<li>I am in a strangled position of maintaining or job or pursuing higher studies.</li>
<li>Unable to distribute time to my loved once properly.</li>
<li>Looking out for new opporutnities in career growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-new-🙄">What&#39;s new? 🙄</h2>
<p>I have learnt a lot. I have understood what independence really means. I have experienced staying really as an adult. I have learnt what it means to implement compared to just knowing. Understood what the world is and how most of the nitty gritty rules of survival have come up. But more than all these, I have started appreciating these small hickups which have actually taught me more than my 22 years of academic life.
Maybe for someone cooking is easy. I learnt it. I discovered that I had inherent cooking skills. The experiementation of flavour combinations made me think maybe I could turn up to be a chef. But most importantly all these means I now know that life is not about stagnation but about exploring more and more.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s Next?</h2>
<p>First of all I am going through a good brain exercising time right now and these have been few best months of my life. I never knew I loved calculations so much until now. I will be completing off some of my goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will try to be regular on my blogging.</li>
<li>Will try to play around with the style of this site.</li>
<li>Discover some discussion forums to be intrgrated here.</li>
<li>Write my bucket list.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a new beginning. Didn&#39;t have much time to write as I am busy in something which I will reveal later. 👋🏻
Note: This is a very small summary of what happened so far. Don&#39;t just assume that such a small stuff happened. 😝</p>
