<p>I have been preparing for CAT for quite some time (6 months). What I feel is that thsi exam is a test of IQ and presense of mind compared to any other thing. No one is checking if I can really speak english, solve complex Algebra or close my eyes and solve rubik&#39;s cube 5x5. So coming to the point what it is all about?
Well, this exam gives some questions in a stipulated time and the paper is more of like a mind game war-field where you need to know what to leave and what to solve and solve using which set of tools.</p>
<p>As of now I want to be short and quick, to what my approach would be. Special edition on full details once I get selected into my dream IIM üòâ.</p>

<ul>
<li>I am strong in understanding an RC. I have focus while reading. So keep it simple while reading RC. Get the main idea of it and solve question with trust on main-idea and gut feel.</li>
<li>Use evidense and elimination to narrow down choices.</li>
<li>Be very sharp while solving VA.</li>
<li>DOn&#39;t get nervous and please don&#39;t try to be hero and make the section look green.</li>
<li>Wherever doubt just mark for review.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lrdi">LRDI</h3>
<ul>
<li>The dreaded section (I used to think so) of the CAT paper. But, not that hard actually.</li>
<li>Solve from first question, don&#39;t panic. Read patiently like you read RCs. Get to the question section and see if it has definite answers and how much can you solve in one go.</li>
<li>Keep a time limit of 15 minutes for first one (if it really is needed).</li>
<li>There are honey pot questions spread across the paper, so move one with sets and just solve the doable ones.</li>
<li>Use options as much required to eliminate cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quants">Quants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Its not hard at all. The exhaustion in previous 2 sections makes it hard. SPecifically the baggage of not able to perform well in LRDI.</li>
<li>So, try to have the attitude of LRDI is anyways tough, and be calm take time to adjust in the final lap.</li>
<li>Get engine going by identifying small liner questions and get a good chunk in first 15 minutes after you settle.</li>
<li>Gain momentum, crack questions and just remember all of these are class 10 questions, you need to solve only the one which gets solved. DOn&#39;t stick to a question if you really odn&#39;t know.</li>
</ul>
<p>And ya that&#39;s it. I think that&#39;s how its done. You know everything that needs to be known, just believe in yourself. And be calm!!</p>
