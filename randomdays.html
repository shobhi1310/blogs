            <p class="date">June 14th 2021</p>
            <p>So this will be my successive post onwhat I am feling nowadays. I am at home as expected and my daily routine is same.</p>
<p>Well, what is my daily routine, let&#39;s read that first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up inthe morning at around 8:30 a.m.</li>
<li>Brushing, drinking one fullglass water, pooping</li>
<li>Taking bath and the whole routine gets completed by 9:00 a.m. at max.</li>
<li>Open laptop (Omen HP üòè)<ul>
<li>If it is intership I switch the <code>Linux Mint</code> OS.</li>
<li>Otherwise <code>Windows 10</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read G-News articles and get to know the daily thingsgoing on around me.</li>
<li>Have lunch cum breakfast cum first meal at around 12:00 p.m.</li>
<li>If too tired have a slight rest by4:00 p.m for around 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
<li>Keep doing stuff on the laptop or attimes just keep staring the screen, thinking about my past life üòÇ.</li>
<li>Have dinner cum end of the day meal at 8:00 p.m.</li>
<li>Start solving algorithmic problems from 9:00 p.m.</li>
<li>After much exhaustion of mind, start chilling on youtube and also with my girl friend on WhatsApp.</li>
<li>Finally wrap up my workspace by 12:00 a.m.</li>
<li>And as we all normal humans know, sleep (but I again talk with my girl-friend and get to know her day, her views all that).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now as far my schedule goes, there is no space for much goofing around or timepass. Do I feel frustrated, yes!! at times. But otherwise till the food supply
is present and my mom is taking care of me and I am talking to my gf, I have no issues.</p>
<p>I wanted towritte something else, but wrote something else only. Anyways, its fine I wrote and am feeling a bit better üòÅ.So cheers to me.</p>
