## Recap

Year 2020 marked the onset of a pandemic with the corona virus and was named **Covid'19**. For india, and the world, as a whole this virus has taken away many lives, and people have been forced to stay at home and work fro home only. This virus has brought the pandemic in various waves and in the form of various variants.

This was the recap incase some introvert never stepped out of home only ðŸ˜’.

## History repeats

Year 2021 was engulfed in **Delta** variant of the virus. But the caseload was finally decreasing, people were coming back to normalcy. All because of vaccination penetration and herd immunity. Then suddenly a new variant named **Omicron** emerged. Its R0 value is very high and it is spreading accross too visciously. Only relief as of now is that its not showing too severe symptoms. ALmost like the near still would be engulfed in pandemic.

## What's in store

We never know. But the point is even if things start getting better, there is always be a ptotential chance of events turning against you. Only way to survive this mess is to accept the fact that:

> Life is not what you expect, but what you can do when it is time to least expect.

Having said that, I am myself always in a constant state of denial ðŸ™„. Hoping things turn out to be good soon. Maybe the spread will be too sporadic and herd immunity will kick in soon.

I miss the good old days ðŸ˜¢.
