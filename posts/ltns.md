😥😓😖

My previous commitment of posting something every week just broke in the first week itself.

Currently I was busy in intersnhip and entertainement, latter being the crucial part 😅.

I have been learning some new technical aspects lately such as docker, aws, full stack development for frontend, etc.

I have also watched the 5th series of Lucifer along with some other movies not much to be happy about.

What I have understood so far is that, life becomes completely monotonous in the long run after a following a strict schedule. So, some
flexibility must be present in our daily routine for some time to bring back the old spirit of work. It should not be too much of a leisure
that the body and soul gets accustomed to.

Basically, it should be like salt in food, neither too salty, nor too flat, and we are the chef.

I will start writing about development works that I learnt so far soon. And let's see if my regular habit of posting per week sustains or not 🤞🏻.
