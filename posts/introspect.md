Recently I have been working on building my resume and I am using website as a medium to depict my portfolio.

I have made plan and blueprint for what needs to be present at which portion of the site. And I was doing pretty good while designing the `html` pages and `css`.

Suddenly I had a plan that I will start writing some content of the portfolio. And then came the most inrospective aspect about myself, the About Me section.
I had palnned to write 2/3 lines on this aspect, but somehow when I started typing, my thoughts went dry as I had nothing to write about myself. I can boast
about my skills, experiences, etc. but I have nothing fundamentally to satte about myself. Now that led me asking myself that was I not anything besides being a CSE 
undergrad. Well, when I talk to someone informally, I never dealt with this dilemna, but introduction would be sort of my native place and some ice-breaker conversations
in the form of some specific niche topics.

Eventually I am in the process of understanding myself and also doing my strength and weakness analysis, but a tip which I have for my fellow readers is that always
think what you would say someone on your first date (date is a broad sense here, you can take it as first meet with any person). That will act as a navigation for you
to structure yourself thoughts. 

And last but not the least, one must always introspect themselves at certain points of time, without any procrastinations for the future. This will help in fixating
and re-iterating your goals.
