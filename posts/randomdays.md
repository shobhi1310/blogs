So this will be my successive post onwhat I am feling nowadays. I am at home as expected and my daily routine is same.

Well, what is my daily routine, let's read that first:

- Wake up inthe morning at around 8:30 a.m.
- Brushing, drinking one fullglass water, pooping
- Taking bath and the whole routine gets completed by 9:00 a.m. at max.
- Open laptop (Omen HP 😏)
  - If it is intership I switch the `Linux Mint` OS.
  - Otherwise `Windows 10`.
- Read G-News articles and get to know the daily thingsgoing on around me.
- Have lunch cum breakfast cum first meal at around 12:00 p.m.
- If too tired have a slight rest by4:00 p.m for around 30 minutes to 1 hour.
- Keep doing stuff on the laptop or attimes just keep staring the screen, thinking about my past life 😂.
- Have dinner cum end of the day meal at 8:00 p.m.
- Start solving algorithmic problems from 9:00 p.m.
- After much exhaustion of mind, start chilling on youtube and also with my girl friend on WhatsApp.
- Finally wrap up my workspace by 12:00 a.m.
- And as we all normal humans know, sleep (but I again talk with my girl-friend and get to know her day, her views all that).

Now as far my schedule goes, there is no space for much goofing around or timepass. Do I feel frustrated, yes!! at times. But otherwise till the food supply
is present and my mom is taking care of me and I am talking to my gf, I have no issues.

I wanted towritte something else, but wrote something else only. Anyways, its fine I wrote and am feeling a bit better 😁.So cheers to me.
