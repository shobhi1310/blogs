## My Thoughts ‚òÅÔ∏è
I have been preparing for CAT for quite some time (6 months). What I feel is that thsi exam is a test of IQ and presense of mind compared to any other thing. No one is checking if I can really speak english, solve complex Algebra or close my eyes and solve rubik's cube 5x5. So coming to the point what it is all about?
Well, this exam gives some questions in a stipulated time and the paper is more of like a mind game war-field where you need to know what to leave and what to solve and solve using which set of tools.

As of now I want to be short and quick, to what my approach would be. Special edition on full details once I get selected into my dream IIM üòâ.

## My appraoch

### VARC
- I am strong in understanding an RC. I have focus while reading. So keep it simple while reading RC. Get the main idea of it and solve question with trust on main-idea and gut feel.
- Use evidense and elimination to narrow down choices.
- Be very sharp while solving VA.
- DOn't get nervous and please don't try to be hero and make the section look green.
- Wherever doubt just mark for review.

### LRDI
- The dreaded section (I used to think so) of the CAT paper. But, not that hard actually.
- Solve from first question, don't panic. Read patiently like you read RCs. Get to the question section and see if it has definite answers and how much can you solve in one go.
- Keep a time limit of 15 minutes for first one (if it really is needed).
- There are honey pot questions spread across the paper, so move one with sets and just solve the doable ones.
- Use options as much required to eliminate cases.

### Quants
- Its not hard at all. The exhaustion in previous 2 sections makes it hard. SPecifically the baggage of not able to perform well in LRDI.
- So, try to have the attitude of LRDI is anyways tough, and be calm take time to adjust in the final lap.
- Get engine going by identifying small liner questions and get a good chunk in first 15 minutes after you settle.
- Gain momentum, crack questions and just remember all of these are class 10 questions, you need to solve only the one which gets solved. DOn't stick to a question if you really odn't know.


And ya that's it. I think that's how its done. You know everything that needs to be known, just believe in yourself. And be calm!!
