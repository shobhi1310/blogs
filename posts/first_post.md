### Ideation and Experimentation

The main idea is to check how well I can write. And being the first post, I do not expect much.
Though for readers to get a context of the situation I am facing right now, the world is currently suffering
from covid and India is in midst of its second wave. Millions of lives have been lost and still counting.

I am safe and have already taken first shot of covishield vaccine, though under restrictions of lockdown.
Sitting ideal at one place, I have though tof starting to spend some of my time on noting down my thoughts on various subjects.
This will help me look back into my ideas and also look into myself from various view points and different emotions.

I hope to post something every week and for me the goal in neither quality nor quantity.

Hoping for best outcome for myself!!
