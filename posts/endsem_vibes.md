## A Free Life

Till now recently, I always thought that I would have a free life when I am in control of my life. I would be working in some job, I would be earning for myself, I would be enjoying the work environment and also witness some major decision making power as well. But now that my end sem is going right now, I looked back upon my entire thought process and I feel I was much free till now, and that very freedom is going to be taken away soon.

## What is freedom?

For me it means, expressing and executing one's set of thoughts without any objection by any person without harming someone's interest. 

And this definition of freedom has always been the same for me, but the meaning of expression and execution has changed as time went by.

- Before teen-age, watching TV, playing games were the execution
- At teen age, talking with friends, gossipping, not liking study much was the execution
- College was about expressing oneself among college peer in all aspects possible to become popular

I can elaborate each line extinsively, but these are for for later times, like when I want to get some sense of relief and want to relieve my past times. For now, I just gave some direct thoughts.

## Way ahead...

As I thought, I would gain freedom, I would like to also ad that it is not gaining freedom, but more of exploring more about freedom. At this point, when I step to the new phase of life, to the outside world, I can't really express myself to a certain extent at workplace or social life as I am bounded by rules of society and have to be answerable. Till now, my parents were bounded and my execution was to experience freedom under that bubble set by my parents.

Now, the bubble is broken and I see a rigid world where boundaries are fixed and people have drowned themsleves in these rules, I see no hope of light which would wash of this sleepiness from us.

```
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action 
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
```

## Epilogue

I wish I were that small kid who had a fire in his eyes to revolt against the slightest dismay. Now that my shackles have been unlocked, I have no purpose but just keep waiting for my demise.
