            <p class="date">June 13th 2021</p>
            <p>Recently I have been working on building my resume and I am using website as a medium to depict my portfolio.</p>
<p>I have made plan and blueprint for what needs to be present at which portion of the site. And I was doing pretty good while designing the <code>html</code> pages and <code>css</code>.</p>
<p>Suddenly I had a plan that I will start writing some content of the portfolio. And then came the most inrospective aspect about myself, the About Me section.
I had palnned to write 2/3 lines on this aspect, but somehow when I started typing, my thoughts went dry as I had nothing to write about myself. I can boast
about my skills, experiences, etc. but I have nothing fundamentally to satte about myself. Now that led me asking myself that was I not anything besides being a CSE 
undergrad. Well, when I talk to someone informally, I never dealt with this dilemna, but introduction would be sort of my native place and some ice-breaker conversations
in the form of some specific niche topics.</p>
<p>Eventually I am in the process of understanding myself and also doing my strength and weakness analysis, but a tip which I have for my fellow readers is that always
think what you would say someone on your first date (date is a broad sense here, you can take it as first meet with any person). That will act as a navigation for you
to structure yourself thoughts. </p>
<p>And last but not the least, one must always introspect themselves at certain points of time, without any procrastinations for the future. This will help in fixating
and re-iterating your goals.</p>
